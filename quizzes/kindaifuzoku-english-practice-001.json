They may worry that prices will change, or that they will make mistakes when paying. In one country, the government replaced old bills with new ones to reduce counterfeiting. The design was beautiful, but many shop owners were nervous. They had to learn new numbers and new security marks quickly.\n\nA student named Hana helped at her family’s small store. She noticed that some customers were embarrassed when they could not recognize the new bills. Hana decided to make a simple guide. She drew pictures of the bills and wrote short tips. She also practiced counting change again and again.\n\nA week later, the store became calmer. Customers started to say, “Thank you. This is easy to understand.” Hana realized that the problem was not only money. It was fear of making a mistake. When people feel safe, they can learn faster.\n\nQuestion 1: Why did the government replace the old bills?",
